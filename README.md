## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The focus of this project was to practice using JavaScript for DOM manipulation with eventListener and event handler functions, and code refactoring

### Continued development

Future JavaScript projects will focus on making code more extensible allowing for better user interaction (for example, allowing the player to submit a guess when the Enter key is pressed) and modification of CSS styles.
